I have worked as teaching assistant for courses in comparative politics, international relations, and Middle East politics. These courses include:

* War and Peace in American Foreign Policy (Kenneth Schultz, Spring 2018)

* Middle Eastern Politics (Lisa Blaydes, Fall 2017)

* Islam, Iran, and the West (Abbas Milani, Spring 2017)

* U.S. Relations with Iran (Abbas Milani, Fall 2016)

I can teach courses on comparative politics, international relations, Middle East Politics, and media and politics. In addition, I can teach methods courses related to experiments, fieldwork, and text-as-data.
