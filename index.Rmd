Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in political science at Stanford University, a graduate fellow at the [Immigration Policy Lab (IPL)](http://immigrationlab.org), and a PhD fellow at the [Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society](https://pacscenter.stanford.edu/).

My research utilizes computational and experimental methods to study authoritarianism, political violence, and refugees and migration.

Prior to arriving at Stanford University, I was a [Junior Fellow](https://carnegieendowment.org/about/jr-fellows) at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. I grew up in Amman, Jordan and graduated from Dartmouth College with a degree in Government.
