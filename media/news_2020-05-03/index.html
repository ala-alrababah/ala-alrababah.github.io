<h3>Ahram</h3>
<p><a href="http://gate.ahram.org.eg/News/2399583.aspx">One hand protects from the pandemic and the other builds the desert</a></p>
<p>Throughout Egyptian history, Sinai has never received this volume of development projects… The roads, tunnels, and bridges tht are being built will change life across all of Egypt and not just Sinai… I have seen the many giant national projects, which were accomplished by the people of Egypt under the leadership of President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi during the past years, and… I did not believe that all of these projects were completed in this record time</p>
<p><a href="http://gate.ahram.org.eg/News/2402578.aspx">The will to win defeats terrorism on the tenth of Ramadan</a></p>
<p>Today, Sunday, is the tenth of Ramadan. It is a day engraved in the memory of the Egyptian people and all Arab peoples from the ocean to the Gulf because it is related to the greatest victory of the Arabs in the modern era, which is the victory of the tenth of Ramadan in 1393 AH, corresponding to the sixth of October 1973 AD… After 6 years of preparation, preparation, and hard training, the Egyptian armed forces succeeded in the greatest Arab victory in modern history, after the legend of the invincible Israeli army was destroyed and incurred heavy losses. The victory restored the dignity and pride of all the Arab peoples.</p>
<p>Now the Egyptian army is fighting the greatest to cleanse the land of Sinai from the desecration of terrorism in the context of the comprehensive process launched by President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi to root out terrorism from all Egyptian lands.</p>
<p><a href="http://gate.ahram.org.eg/News/2402582.aspx">Egyptian entrepreneurship!</a></p>
<p>Egypt’s leadership in arts is not in doubt. However, this position is facing strong competition from other centers that are rising rapidly, especially in the Gulf region, which is filled with oil wealth, including Dubai, as well as strong competition from Turkey.</p>
<p>In the face of this competition, why don’t wealthy Egyptians invest in artistic production in Egypt? I believe that the state and the ministries of culture and media should strongly encourage them to do so.</p>
<p><a href="http://gate.ahram.org.eg/News/2402675.aspx">“The Choice” (a television series) between the Brotherhood and Salafi Jihadism</a></p>
<p>The nature of the relationship between the Brotherhood and Jihadi salafism ranges from competition (for who speaks in the name of Islam), mutual recruitment and alliances, to bloody fighting when it comes to struggling over power.</p>
<p>The month before Morsi’s ouster (i.e. June 2013) witnessed only 7 [terrorist] operations, while the month immediately following it (the month of his ouster, July 2013) witnessed the biggest upsurge in the pace of operations, 112 terrorist attacks. Throughout 2012, only 45 attacks took place in North Sinai, while the year 2013 in which Morsi was toppled witnessed 236 terrorist attacks… This suggests that [as mentioned in the television series “The Choice”], during Morsi’s role, [terrorists] wanted to give Islamic rule a chance but after this fell everyone went back to the first square of Jihad.</p>

She said that there will be no decline in economic growth in Egypt.</p>

<p>Our readers know that since last year we have stopped taking the Ramadan drama seriously. But we will preserve our annual tradition [of writing about it]. This year, due to the low level of dramas, we tried to decide on a television series that you can watch while surrendering, with indifference, a series that simply “transgresses.” This series is called “in 100 faces” and talks about a professional conwoman who gets conned by another professional conman to end up fighting and then uniting to organize a major con.</p>
