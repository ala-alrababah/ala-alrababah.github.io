<p><a href="http://gate.ahram.org.eg/News/2404252.aspx">Rami Makhlouf</a></p>
<p>What is the reason behind the public dispute between Makhlouf and Assad? It is said that the Russians are pressuring Assad to pay for the costs of the Russian protection of Syria, which is leading Assad to pressure his businessmen, such as Makhlouf, to provide the regime with funding. Other causes are suggested, mainly that there is a dispute between Makhlouf and Asma’ Al-Assad or that because Makhlouf is an Alawite, he may be trying to become the president.</p>
<p><a href="http://gate.ahram.org.eg/News/2404249.aspx">Having the capability</a></p>
<p>President Sisi has long emphasized the slogan, “having the capability.” This slogan can be seen in the Egyptian response to Corona, which included establishing a factory for orthopedic supplies and another for manufacturing secure syringes, among others. These efforts will allow the Egyptian state to “have the capability” when it comes to medical technology.</p>
<p><a href="http://gate.ahram.org.eg/News/2404085.aspx">To combat the Corona pandemic… The administrative control unit continues to confront the exploiters of the crisis and takes preventive measures</a></p>
<p><a href="http://gate.ahram.org.eg/News/2404372.aspx">Humat Al-Watan party requests that citizens comply with the government directives and learn from the experiences of other countries</a></p>
<p>The party leader praised the efforts of the Egyptian state, and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, in facing the danger of the Corna outbreak. He praised the president’s interest in Egyptians stranded abroad and his recent decisions regarding Egyptian communities around the world, stressing that this position not new or strange for President Sisi, as we are accustomed to having the president issue decisions that serve Egyptians at home and abroad.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/1975665">“The problem is not with the quarantine hour but rather with your behavior”… The details of the PM’s conference</a></p>
<p>The PM said that they are examining the calls to apply more restrictive measures and dealing with citizens in more severe and firm ways, asserting that the increase in Corona cases is not related to the quarantine hours but is rather caused by the behavior of citizerns before quarantine takes places.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/1975637">The Chief of Staff breaks fast with the counter-terrorism forces in northern Sinai</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/1975464">The importance of the people’s participation in economic decision making</a></p>
<p>The people have the right to learn the truth about the economic situation, no matter how difficult it is, and to be partners in the decision-making process, because at the end of the day they will be bearing the economic cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/1975332">“The end” and anger with no end!!</a></p>
<p>The television series, the end, shows that Egyptians continue to refuse normalization with Israel and wish for the end of Israel, even after 100 years. Cultural boycott is the only weapon that Arabs have and the television series, The End, shows that anger at Israeli measures knows no end.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/1975375">Will the state continue to support recklessness?</a></p>
<p>The state initially called for measures to stop Corona but the people did not obey. The president was clear that the life of citizens is more important to him than economic activity. But many people did not listen to the state’s calls, which is leading the state to reopen economic activity. But are we waiting for a massive increase in the number of Corona cases? I say, the time for recklessness is over and the lack of commitment is the reason why the number of cases continues to go up. This is the time for us to wake up and start adhering to the state’s calls. When it comes to will, the Egyptians who conquered the Bar Lev Line can tell the world that we conquered Corona.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/1975366">The public does not want this</a></p>
<p>Egypt used to excel in producing religious and historic television series in Ramadan but we have stopped doing this and the void has since been filled by Syria and Iran. The excuse used by producers is that the public does not want these types of series. But the success of “The Choice” shows that the public wants these shows.</p>

<p>There is no avoidance to being careful, adapting, and coexisting with Corona. We should abide by these matters instead of violating the precautionary measures and quarantine, which we replace with our well-known habit of accusing the government, reprimanding its decisions, and throwing it with the bullets of destructive opposition.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youm7.com/story/2020/5/7/أسئلة-مشروعة-لك-سيدى-المواطن/4762993">Legitimate questions for you, Mr. Citizen</a></p>
<p>A series of questions and answers that show the state’s response to the Corona outbreak has been quite impressive but the citizens have not done their role and did not abide by the state’s orders. The article then concludes that its goal was not to hold one side or the other responsible but rather to find a way out of this crisis.</p>
