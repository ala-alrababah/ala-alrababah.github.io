<h3>Al-Ayyam</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.alayam.com/alayam/first/855482/News.html">Terrorists may take advantage of the world’s preoccupation with the Corona pandemic… the British ambassador for “Al-Ayyam”</a></p>
<p>In an interview with Al-Ayyam, the British ambassador to Bahrain said that the response of the Bahraini health system to the spread of COVID-19 was exemplary and rapid, pointing to the impressive success of the Bahraini responses especially since it only took two months.</p>
<p>He also pointed out that Iranian movements over the past month are a good reminder of the danger posed by Iran but that the UK, US, and other allies in the region are ready to respond to potential Iranian aggression.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.alayam.com/alayam/local/854613/News.html">“Developing a sterilization device with 100% Bahraini hands at a very little financial cost”</a></p>
<p>The creativity of Bahraini youth continues, in all circumstances, and despite all the difficulties of the stage… As everyone devotes their energies and efforts to serving their kingdom, and this is what led a group of Bahraini youth, with 100% local efforts, to design a sterilization device using human solutions approved by international organizations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.alayam.com/Article/courts-article/415691/إيران-احتفال-استفزازي.html?vFrom=mpLWT">Iran… a provocative celebration</a>
On April 30 of each year, Iran celebrates what it calls “the Persian Gulf Day”, which is an ancient tradition invented by Ismail al-Safawi centuries ago. The Iran of Khomeini and Khamenei has continued to celebrate and revive this day in a provocative way, in which the priests of the regime use this opportunity to expose their expansionist ambitions in the region and in Bahrain.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.alayam.com/Article/courts-article/415693/العمالة-الأجنبية--المذنبة-والضحية-.html?vFrom=mpLWT">Foreign labor: guilty and victim</a>
The modernization of cities in the Gulf was associated with a foreign labour that has been expanding. This has led to a population with “occupational panic” in Kuwait and “demographic panic” in the UAE that was associated with fears of “obliterating national identity.” And rather than learn from these cases, we are finding that the population imbalance has only increased in the Gulf. Over the years, foreign labor has come into the Gulf not illegally but using legal work contracts but have been used so badly taht they are often called “the new slaves.” This situation leads the foreign workers to become “a timed bomb” as the hungry masses can revolt and may be used by hidden organizations that have an interest in maintaining the black market, insecurity, and crimes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.albiladpress.com/news/2020/4220/columns/642991.html">A stupid play</a></p>
<p>In a tweet, Anadolu News Agency wrote that Saudi Arabia has been possessed by a state of terror as a result of the Corona epidemic. When in reality, Saudi Arabia has taken successful pre-emptive steps at the beginning of the crisis to limit the disease and prevent its spread. Weeks later, Turkey attempted to imitate the Saudi steps in a way that has led us to say that the Turks, not the Saudis, have been possessed by fear.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.al-akhbar.com/Politics/288099/صندوق-النقد-الفقراء-أكثر-فقرا">The International Monetary Fund: The poor getting poorer</a>
According to an article published in The Guardian, when people think about the harm that rich countries–led by the US and its allies–cause to others around the world, they usually think of work. But rich countries also have a major influence over the lives of billions of people, through their control of global institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.al-akhbar.com/World/288055/فنزويلا-تحبط-هجوما-إرهابيا-عبر-الحدود-مع-كولومبي">Venezuela thwarts a terrorist attack across the border with Colombia</a></p>
<p>The government of Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro announced today that it thwarted an attempted naval incursion by “terrorist mercenaries,” across the border with neighboring Colombia. The attack comes at a time when Washington has not reduced its campaign against Maduro and his government.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.al-akhbar.com/Opinion/287822/ضابط-ومقاول-وإعلامي-كيف-ت-دار-أزمة-كورونا-في-مصر">An officer, a contractor, and a journalist: How the Corona crisis is being managed in Egypt?</a></p>
<p>The Corona crisis in Egypt shows a deeper governance crisis. Egypt has known for months how dangerous the Corona virus can be, but only decided to close the borders and implement a quarantine when two generals died of Corona virus, after contact with engineers from a Chinese company who have been working on the new capital project. When the Egyptian president received suggestions that a quarantine should be implemented from 3 p.m. and afterwards, he immediately rejected this suggestion, and was accompanied by the media and notable businessmen. Egyptian media continues to play an important role in slowing down the response to Corona. But now, Egypt is facing a serious economic crisis which will exacerbate if the quarantine is not lifted. This will lead the parliament to meet and discuss how to combat “Coronaphobia” and the conspiracy to undermine the Egyptian economy. If this regime has spent its effort on combating Corona rather than protecting the regime, it would have gotten rid of the virus a month ago. So Egypt is infested with a governance problem . Its problem is not how to deal with Corona but rather how to treat itself from a chronic Virus that has lasted for 10 years, which is getting rid of Sisi… from the inside.</p>

<p>Current and former ministers and MPs from the Greek Orthodox sect attended the headquarters of the Archdiocese of Beirut to be met by the Bishop Elias Odeh. They discussed the affairs of the sect as well as the marginalization it faces. The Biship asserted that we are dealing with our issues morally but the country is beginning to lose its morals and we will no longer accept injustice.</p>

<p>In a speech, Hassan Nasrallah condemned the German decising to ban Hezbollah, describing it as a “submission to Americal and an attempt to please Israel.” He also declared his support for the government’s plan to deal with the economic and financial situation in the country. On seeking economic aid, he said that he is not against asking for assistance from any party except for Lebanon’s enemies. But he refuses to totally surrender to the conditions of the International Monetary Fund. He also attacked the banking sector for profiting over many years and now refusing to provide the country with any assistance but said that he does not want to destroy the banking sector.</p>

[The Hariri uprising](https://mustaqbalweb.com/article/98701-انتفاضة-الحريري)
PM Saad Al-Hariri has not let the 15th anniversary of the martyrdom of former PM Rafic Hariri pass by as a mere commemorative moment. Rather, he used this occasion to call for an uprising against all those who are holding him responsible for where the country is today. Those rudely suggest that his father also bears responsibility

<p>Passing by the grave of former PM Rafic Hariri, I could not stop a tear for the memory of the man who was burned during his life and burned again in his death, and whose soul continues to burn in sadness for this country. Those who are building their glory now by claiming taht they want to get rid of Harirism, need someone like Hariri to save them and to restore hope to the people.</p>

<p>The talk about the Syrian regime has become a thing of the past. There is no return to Assad’s Syria which had control over Syria and an important regional role. Syria is now under a Russian “mandate,” which has cost Iran some influence. The Russian control over Syria could cost Iran its land bridge to Lebanon, which leads to the question: who will Lebanon belong to? Washington is attempting to prevent Iranian and Russian control over Lebanon, which could suggest that Lebanon may not be under the influence of one country like Syria but could become under the influence of several countries.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.aljoumhouria.com/ar/news/530731/ثورة-شعب-جوعوه">A revolution of people who were starved</a>
The revolution in Lebanon has changed. While it used to be the revolution of people who were afraid of starving, now it is the revolution of people who have been starved [by those in power]. Those who have been harmed by the revolution accuse the protestors by describing them as infiltrators who are using the pain of the people to break and burn the banks. But what does the government expect from a people who are starvign, whose money has evaporated in the banks, whose national currency turned to mere ink on papers, and who is suffering from extremely high food prices?</p>
