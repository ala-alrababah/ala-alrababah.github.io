<p>What is the goal of the systematic U.S. targeting of China? Is it to cover up the failure of the US administration’s response to the epidemic? Is it related to the presidential campaign and the conflict between Democrats and Republicans? Or is it part of the Trump policy of blackmail and earn money?</p>
<p>The American exaggeration of the Chinese threat will continue, especially since the lie of Russian interference in the last presidential elections has grown old, and they now need a new external enemy by which they can justify their unethical policies and actions around the world.</p>
<p><a href="http://newspaper.albaathmedia.sy/2020/05/08/مكانة-سورية-الإقليمية-للتدقيق/">Syria’s regional position</a>
The continuation of the war against Syria without resolving it is in the Israeli interest, a vision adopted by “Israel” as it is the largest beneficiary of the continuation of this ongoing war as a result of the presence of the remnants of terrorism that entered Syria with the support, direction and support of the United States of America, Erdogan and the Arabs of nationality whose hands were stained with clean and pure Syrian blood.</p>

<p><a href="http://tishreen.news.sy/?p=490343">Smuggling… and then smuggling</a></p>
<p>Many families with limited income are unable to eat meat. War is not hte sole reason behind the increase in the price of meat but also the smuggling of sheep through Iraq or Jordan to the Gulf, as more than 200 thousand sheep are smuggled every year to other countries. The responsibility for this remains with the conerned authorities, especially the customs. It is important to set and implement major punishments to deter them from smuggling.</p>
<p><a href="http://tishreen.news.sy/?p=490350">An iron hand!</a></p>
<p>The campaign to combat smuggling has failed at stopping the smuggling of vegetables and fruit which has massively increased their prices for Syrians while citizens of other countries are finding them cheap.</p>
<p><a href="http://tishreen.news.sy/?p=490248">Bin Salman in Trump’s trap</a></p>
<p>After a war of attrition for two months, the price of oil is gradually increasing. This followed a phone call during which Donald Trump threatened the Crown Prince of the Saudi Regime with a full withdrawal of the US forces from the kingdom if the Saudis did not reduce oil production. This war has brought bin Salman further humiliation and failure both domestically and in the United States. This will make it more difficult for bin Salman to rebuild (communication) bridges with teh Congress.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the tyrants fell. They were forced to leave and our people’s heroic acts and the sacrifices dismantled the colonial attempts that targeted our nation, that targeted the Arab nation.</p>
<p>Syria will be victorious soon but not before it forces the West and all those that follow the Zionist-American axis to recognize the power of Syria. In these times, Syria is winning, creating history, and writing again as it should be written. Glory and eternity to our martyrs.</p>
<p><a href="http://thawra.sy/index.php/witout-constraint/229441-2020-05-05-10-05-25">Because it is worthy</a></p>
<p>The meeting of President Bashar al-Assad yesterday with the governmental group concerned with confronting the Corona pandemic and its repercussions was important in terms of reassuring the Syrians that the Syrian state is aware of the difficulties facing them in light of the spread of the Corona pandemic.</p>
<p>The president accurately and logically described the reality and spoke with transparency and honesty about the difficulties that Syrians are experiencing. The meeting also proposed a set of effective and decisive solutiosn to everything that concerns Syrians during this period.</p>
<p>The president asserted the importance of proposing non-traditional solutions that fit the current crisis and that are different from previous solutions. The president also asked the group to propose laws and changes to legislation in roder to increase the severity of punishments to traders and monopolizers who are leading to higher prices.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important message is that the Syrian state clearly realizes the situation and is able to take solutions to protect its citizens. For this, we repeat: let us trust the state as it has continued to prove that it is worthy of our trust.</p>

<p>When discussing the Syrian-Russian relations, it is political stupidity to “predict” any dispute between Moscow and Damascus. The relationship between the two countries and the two leaders, Assad and Putin, is not a war-born relationship and it is not a relationship that can have differences in positions or disputes.</p>
<p>It is a strategic, decades old, relationship that is based on respect for international law, national sovereignty of states, and the fight against terrorism.</p>

<p>The Lebanese sectarian system has collapsed. This system was falsely called “national reconciliation,” as the country should be represented by citizens, regardless of their religion, beliefs and ethnicity. The country should not be represented by clans and sects, as happened in 1943 with the support and incitement of Westerners, in order to keep Lebanon a game in the hands of the colonists, whoever the colonists are.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for the collapse of this system, including 1- the increase in the number of beneficiaries of this system beyond control 2- the inability of this system to sustain itself without an outside arbiter. Thi ssectarian system has harmed mainly the smaller sects, such as the Greek Orthodox, and it has mainly benefited large ones including Sunnis, Shia, and Maronites.</p>
