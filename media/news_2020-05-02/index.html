<p>The Egyptian government continues to rush towards a full return to service and financial activities after the end of the month of Ramadan, despite the worsening situation of the new Corona epidemic, the steady increase in the number of daily casualties… and the failure of the state to conduct random tests even in areas that witnessed high infection rates.</p>

<p>The Jordanian government’s decision to extend the leave for the public sector beyond Ramadan has raised the concerns of government workers, who are now afraid for the future of their jobs. This is especially in light of the government’s tendencies to reduce the numbers of workers in the public sector.</p>

<p>A network of secret prisons and cellars of torture affiliated with the Houthi militia is located in the Taiz neighborhood of Sana’a, camouflaged between schools and homes.

<p>With the Khomeinist regime in deep trouble again, the usual suspects launched a campaign to portray the Islamic Republic as a victim, and US President Donald Trump as the persecutor.</p>
<p>Fingers and blame have slowly shifted from the mullahs to the Trump administration, as the debate has been redirected to address the hypothetical question of US military action rather than addressing the real mistakes of the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>Banners have appeared saying “No to war against Iran”, although it would be more beneficial to say “No to wars by Iran.” Others are claiming that the Mullahs are behaving badly because because Trump refuses to speak to them when in fact he has repeatedly said he is ready to speak to them anywhere and anytime.</p>

<p>They brag and say that the era of Muhammad Ali Pasha and his successors, as well as their achievements, should be credited to the Ottoman presence in Egypt. This narrative ignores that Muhammed Ali Pasha’s rule over Egypt represented the strength of the Egyptian national will, despite the opposition of the Ottoman occupier, who did not stop his attempts to overthrow the governor. The governor’s mandate from the beginning was the end of the Ottomans’ brutal occupation.</p>

<p><a href="https://aawsat.com/home/article/2263091/محمد-الرميحي/احتمالات-الثورة-الإيرانية-القادمة">The prospects for the next Iranian revolution</a>
The American magazine “Foreign Affairs”, which is influential in directing the policies of the United States has recently published a long study on “the necessity of working to change the Iranian regime.” The study lists a large number of reasons that explain why regime change is a realistic plan. The study relied on a correct assumption: that after all these years, this regime in Iran has failed to respect international laws and provide its citizens with a minimum level of decent living.</p>
<p><a href="https://aawsat.com/home/article/2263086/إميل-أمين/الحظر-لـ«حزب-الله»-والرسالة-لإيران">The ban for Hezbollah and the message to Iran</a></p>
<p>Better late than never. This appears to be the case in Europe with Hezbollah. After Britain last January, now it is Germany’s turn, in a dramatic departure from the previous Berlin policy that was based on the position of the European Union.</p>

<p>Important recent reforms in Saudi Arabia improve human rights, include stopping the death sentence for those under 18 and replacing it with up to 10 years of prison in juvenile prison. Another reform includes stopping flogging and replacing it with prison sentencing or fines. Saudi is embarking on real reforms and not cosmetic procedures. These are internal decisions not driven by external pressures, which have existed for many years and have been ignored by Saudi Arabia.</p>
