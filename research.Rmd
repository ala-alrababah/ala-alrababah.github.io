### Dissertation Project
Starting in late 2010, major uprisings across the Middle East toppled four of the world's longest serving dictators, creating hope  for democratization in several Arab countries. Prominent scholars and observants of the Middle East claimed that new technologies in media, primarily satellite TV and the internet, were essential for the success of the uprisings because they facilitated the spread of new ideas, avoided state censorship, and provided protest leaders with powerful tools to organize and mobilize effectively. A few years later, as democratization faltered across the region, scholars began to blame the media for playing a particularly destructive role in the political transitions that followed the uprisings, in particular because they were often used by regimes to counter reformist efforts and bring about an authoritarian resurgence. How did these authoritarian regimes learn to counter the effects of new media, and what did these efforts look like? More generally, how have autocrats responded to the loss of their monopoly over information that resulted from advances in media technology?

My dissertation project attempts to examine how Arab autocratic regimes responded to the rise of new media. I argue that autocrats adapted by using media to psychologically manipulate their publics. Before the proliferation of satellite television and internet media, autocrats had direct control over information through ownership of media organizations and censorship of unwanted articles. But once autocrats could no longer censor new media tools as effectively, they responded to this challenge by controlling available information in order to psychologically manipulate Arab publics. Specifically, autocrats use information to manipulate fear and optimism in ways that reduce the potential for domestic popular mobilization against the regime and influence foreign publics in ways that serve regime interests.
